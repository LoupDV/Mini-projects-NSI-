# Snowflake Collector â€“ NSI Project

This was a small game project developed during my NSI class.  
The idea was simple: control a shovel to collect falling snowflakes.  

Over time, unfortunately, the project stopped working properly.  
It may be due to changes in the browser, Brython, or the environment (originally developed on Replit).

## Features

- External library: Brython (included in the `libraries` folder)
- Developed on Replit (before major changes to the platform)

## Notes

This game is no longer fully functional due to unknown compatibility issues,  
but the core logic and interface remain in the source code for reference.  
Let me know if you'd like to access it or see a walkthrough of how it worked.
